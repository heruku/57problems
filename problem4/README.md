Problem4 - Mad Lib
========

Create a simple Mad-Lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.
i.e:
```
Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
"Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!"
```
Constraints:
* Use a single output statement for this program.
* If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it to build up the output.

Extra Challenges:
* Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
* Implement a branching story, where the answers to questions determine how the story is constructed.
