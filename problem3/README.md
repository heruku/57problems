Problem 3 - Printing Quotes:
Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author.
i.e:
```
What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for
Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
```
Constraints:
  * Use a single output statement to produce this output, using appropriate string escaping techniques for quotes.
  * If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, do not use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.

Extra Challenges:
  * Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user, you create a structure that holds quotes and their associated attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in the example. An array of maps would be an option.
